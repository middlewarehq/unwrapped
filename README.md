2. [ Next Auth Secret](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options): Configure NextAuth.
3. [RSA Key Pair Generation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent): Generate `TOKEN_ENC_PUB_KEY` and `TOKEN_ENC_PRI_KEY`.
4. Create a `.env.local` file with the following structure:
    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENVIRONMENT="development"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_ENVIRONMENT="development"
    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
    GITHUB_ID=GITHUB_ID
    GITHUB_SECRET=GITHUB_SECRET
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=NEXTAUTH_SECRET
    NEXT_PUBLIC_MIXPANEL=NEXT_PUBLIC_MIXPANEL
    TOKEN_ENC_PUB_KEY=TOKEN_ENC_PUB_KEY
    TOKEN_ENC_PRI_KEY=TOKEN_ENC_PRI_KEY
    GLOBAL_GH_PAT=GLOBAL_GH_PAT
